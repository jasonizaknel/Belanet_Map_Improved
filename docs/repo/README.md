# repo — Folder

- Name: repo
- Path: ./repo
- Type: Folder (legacy docs)

## Purpose & Responsibility
Contains a legacy repository overview (`belanet-map-improved.md`). This content is superseded by the new `/docs` hierarchy.

## Risk & Cleanup
- Marked obsolete; retain for history until `/docs` adoption is stable. Candidates for deletion post-migration.
## Naming & Structural Consistency
- Consistency: mixed but generally coherent; standardize during refactor
- Case Styles: prefer kebab-case for files, camelCase for JS identifiers
- Normalization: align folder/file naming, collapse near-duplicates
- Import Paths: prefer relative paths consolidated via clear top-level entry points
