# Belanet_Map_Improved — Folder

- Name: Belanet_Map_Improved
- Path: ./Belanet_Map_Improved
- Type: Folder (assets/screenshots)

## Purpose & Responsibility
Contains UI screenshots and visual references used during design/debugging of the mapping tool.

## Contents Overview
- Capture.JPG, Capture2.JPG — Screenshot images
- Screenshot ... png — Additional UI/state screenshots

## Dependency Graph
- No code references detected in repository; assets are not imported by HTML/CSS.

## Risk & Cleanup
- Candidates for deletion or archival outside repo history. Keep out of runtime bundles.
- Safe to delete after confirming no external docs link to these filenames.
## Naming & Structural Consistency
- Consistency: mixed but generally coherent; standardize during refactor
- Case Styles: prefer kebab-case for files, camelCase for JS identifiers
- Normalization: align folder/file naming, collapse near-duplicates
- Import Paths: prefer relative paths consolidated via clear top-level entry points
